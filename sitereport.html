            <h1>SITE REPORT</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Learning and understanding the fundamentals of html and it's styling properties has been fun, interacting
                but faced with a bit of a challenge. This year has been different since we have been able to have a hands-on
                experience learning in a lecture hall as opposed to how it was before during the covid period where we all had to isolate
                and have online lectures which was tedious. The numerous number of errors and even misplaced code has also attributed to
                this amazing journey but all in all having to learn html has been enjoyable. </p>
            <p>
                Firstly the overall fear, or rather my personal fear is failure. I presumed that I will fail in programming even before I set foot 
                into the coding world. I saw a lot of concepts which was a bit overwhelming that brought about emotions such as self-doubt but I was
                able to overcome this. Lastly, I managed to grasp the concepts a bit later than the rest and I had constant thought of it being already too
                late to learn.
            </p>  <br> 


            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>
                I chose this particular layout because of its simplicity and I found it eye-catching while still delivering the message I intended to put out there for the
                world to see. For the background, I decided to go with that particular image because I am a big fan of aesthetics and that piece caught my attention
                and I felt like it would best suit my portfolio. As of the image in the main layout, I chose it because I am an artist and seeing that individual trying
                to sketch something caught my attention and the decision was made. 
            </p> <br> 
            

            <h2>Progression</h2>
            <p>
                I decided to change the overall design of my portfolio in terms of the formatting features since I felt like it was too basic and needed to be more personalized
                highlighting an individuals personality. <br>
                Below are the snapshots of the html and css of the previous layout before changing to this particular layout;
